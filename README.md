**Project description**
Implementation of an undirected graph using adjacency list and implementation of a breadth-first search on the graph. 
Expected limitations of the prgoram include the following: only integer value may be used as the vertices value; the size of the input values provided.

**Program design**
The App class served as a driver class. The Graph class consised of algorithms necessary to implement both a graph representation, 
breadth-first search, as well as printing the adjacency list.
